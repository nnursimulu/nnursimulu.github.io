Welcome! My name is Nirvana Nursimulu. I love [science](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nnursimulu/), math, music, improv ... and 
writing.

Here, you will find samples of my scientific and creative writing experiments 
(which I occasionally illustrate).

A quick shout-out to the SickKids Training Post where many of my stories have 
been published. Huge thank you to the editors!
