How do I start my new blog?  

What is that first post going to address?  

Is the layout perfect?

I have spent many fine minutes pondering over that question, analyzing the which,
the when, the what, the where, the how ... but sometimes you've just got to 
go for it.  So here it is.  

I dearly hope you stick around.  I have short stories I want to share with you, 
stories sprinkled with a bit of magic here and there, often with scientists in
the midst.  Otherwise, you may be interested in my scientific
writing experiments.  I intend to cover a wide array of topics ... anything from
artificial intelligence to parasites.  

In any case, I must admit that I am excited to be using Jekyll to make this blog.
With my previous blogs, I cannot say that I have had as much control over the 
layout ... although (and I chuckle as I think about this) I am not entirely sure
that I will not stick with this minimal layout.

Well, I will just have to see how it goes.  Till next time.
