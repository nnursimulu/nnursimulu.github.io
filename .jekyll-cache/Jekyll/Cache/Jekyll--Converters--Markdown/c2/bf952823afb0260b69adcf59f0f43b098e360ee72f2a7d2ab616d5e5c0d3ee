I"\<p>When I think of doctors, I will admit that one of the first images that comes to my mind is that of Dr Gregory House. No, not really in terms of bedside manner, but more in terms of his problem-solving skills. For a long time, he impressed me with his dedication, even at the eleventh hour.  He could easily find connections between previous cases, go through a patient’s history quickly but also meticulously, tirelessly keep on looking for any abnormalities…Well, Dr House is not a real person. I am not a doctor myself but I can imagine that productively going through a similar kind of problem-solving process day after day (at the beginning of a shift, at the end of long hours) must require an incredible amount of energy, skill and dedication. All while time is of the essence. Hats off to doctors, nurses and all other medical staff. Truly.</p>
