I"Ç<p>I was first exposed to a major problem in a scientific field in my third year of undergraduate studies.  My friends and I sat entranced in a lecture hall on the first floor of the Bahen Centre as we learned about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem">P versus NP problem</a>.  This problem requires its very own blog post, but basically, the main question of this problem is whether a certain class of hard computational problems can be solved in a ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù amount of time.  At the time, some part of me used to imagine students and professors frantically scribbling away their ideas, drafting accidental new papers on their way to solving the enigma, and <i>definitely</i> drinking jug after jug of coffee.  The very next semester, I learned about the protein folding problem, an instance of a very hard problem in biology.  As an idealistic undergraduate student, I used to imagine that someday, someone would solve the P versus NP problem and that this would be the key towards solving the problem folding problem.  Little did I know that it would be advances in machine learning that would change everything!</p>
