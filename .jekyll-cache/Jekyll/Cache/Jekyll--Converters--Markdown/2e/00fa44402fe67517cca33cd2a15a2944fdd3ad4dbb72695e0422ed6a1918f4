I"	<p>I was first exposed to a major problem in a scientific field in my third year of undergraduate studies.  My friends and I sat entranced in a lecture hall on the first floor of the Bahen Centre as we learned about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem">P versus NP problem</a>.  This problem requires its very own blog post, but basically, the main question of this problem is whether a certain class of hard computational problems can be solved in a “reasonable” amount of time.  At the time, some part of me used to imagine students and professors frantically scribbling away their ideas, drafting accidental new papers on their way to solving the enigma, and <i>definitely</i> drinking jug after jug of coffee.  The very next semester, I learned about the protein folding problem, an instance of a very hard problem in biology.  As an idealistic undergraduate student, I used to imagine that someday, someone would solve the P versus NP problem and that this would be the key towards solving the problem folding problem.  Little did I know that it would be advances in machine learning that would change everything!</p>

<p>DNA was established as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2135445/">the hereditary material in 1944</a> with its three-dimensional double helix structure <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/171737a0">resolved in the 1950s</a>.  While DNA serves as the blueprint for an organism’s make-up, protein molecules perform various essential functions within organisms.  Just think of insulin: this vital protein has <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30405529/">extended the lifespan of so many individuals across the world</a>.  At the same time, the function of a protein is related to how it folds, that is, its structure.  For example, at high temperature, insulin is <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245372">inactivated at high temperatures</a>, at least in part due to changes in its structure.  Now, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22393/">experimental methods</a> for determining a protein’s structure are time-consuming, and can be especially complicated for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2580798/">certain types of proteins</a>.</p>
