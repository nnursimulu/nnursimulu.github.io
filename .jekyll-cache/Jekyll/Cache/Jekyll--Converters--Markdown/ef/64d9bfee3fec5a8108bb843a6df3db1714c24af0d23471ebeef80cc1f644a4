I"¾<p><em>On Hallowsâ€™ eve, from the ground and the heavens, come spirits that have expired 
and are yet to arrive. Time unwinds itself from the clutches of reality, and for 
one night, words like â€œyesterdayâ€, â€œtomorrowâ€, â€œpossiblyâ€, and â€œneverâ€ bear no 
meaning whatsoever. Eternity exists all at once. All around us, the planets, 
stars and galaxies shudder in a cacophony of possibilities: birth, life, and 
death all co-exist as the gigantic and marvellous defy all the laws of physics. 
Unfortunately, our conscious and subconscious minds are programmed to dismiss 
these anomalies, letting them succumb into oblivion. Rationality always comes in 
the way of imaginationâ€¦</em></p>
