I"ç<p>Growing up, the traditional view I had of a scientist was that of an individual wearing a lab coat, goggles, and gloves, either holding a test tube over a Bunsen burner or growing cells on a Petri dish Jurassic Park-style.  As I have moved from high school to undergrad to graduate school, my perspective has certainly changed quite a bit, especially as I have been involved in more computational projects.  Suddenly, I have found myself amongst scientists intent on understanding organism growth who never actually look away from their computer screens during the entire workday (except for a little stretch, lunch or coffee of course!).  What is the place of <em>in</em> <em>silico</em> experiments in biological fields?  In this series, I present several examples where real-life problems (in the biological fields or adjacent to those) can be tackled using computers. These will not necessarily be directly related to my work but I hope they inspire you as much as they have inspired me!</p>
