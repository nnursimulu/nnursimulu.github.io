I"ê<h3>The Scientist on Vacation</h3>
<p><em>There was constant typing, constant thinking, constant grumbling. Not a single moment of peace, not a single moment of bliss, there was only constant pioneering, as the typing went towards forging what could only be impossibly good ideas for what could only be a fantastic tomorrow‚Ä¶but a tomorrow for whom I ask, if not for the typists, the thinkers, the grumblers? What of those who stood in the shadows, set up there for show, for a semblance of warmth, for comfort? And again for whom to give comfort, if not for the pioneers of tomorrow, the typists of typists, the fantastic forgers of the morrow?</em></p>
