I"™<p>Welcome! My name is Nirvana Nursimulu. I love <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nnursimulu/">science</a>, math, music, improv â€¦ and 
writing.</p>

<p>Here, you will find samples of my scientific and creative writing experiments 
(which I occasionally illustrate).</p>

<p>A quick shout-out to the SickKids Training Post where many of my stories have 
been published. Huge thank you to the editors!</p>
