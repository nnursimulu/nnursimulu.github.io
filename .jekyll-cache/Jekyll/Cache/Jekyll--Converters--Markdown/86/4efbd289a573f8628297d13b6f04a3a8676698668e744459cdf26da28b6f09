I"š<p><em>I often dream that my father is taking us on a tour of the island we come from.
The sky is an ethereal blue and the lagoon a shimmering reflection.  Eventually,
our red Peugeot somehow brings us right to the edge of the water.  Then, as
these dreams always go, my father drives straight into the sea, our car
strangely buoyant.  It is a little scary as I can feel the ocean tugging us this
way, that way, anywhere except to the side where land awaits us.  Still, this
remains a wonderful moment for me as the sea is endless and full of surprises.
Such is the dream that I visit when I am uncertain of myself; such is my state
when I wish for wisdom.</em></p>
